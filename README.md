# Single-Cell-RNA-Seq-Analysis-of-PBMCs
Fundamental workflow for single-cell analysis by reproducing a standard analysis of a public dataset. Dataset: 3k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (10x Genomics).


I'm currently working through the analysis pipeline, including QC, normalization, and clustering. The completed notebook will be uploaded here upon completion.
