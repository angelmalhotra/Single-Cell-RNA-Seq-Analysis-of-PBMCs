# Single-Cell-RNA-Seq-Analysis-of-PBMCs

Working with a classic and well-understood dataset: 3,000 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor. This dataset is publicly available from 10x Genomics.

Goal: To learn the fundamental workflow for single-cell analysis by reproducing a standard analysis of a public dataset.
I'm currently working through the analysis pipeline, including QC, normalization, and clustering. The completed notebook will be uploaded here upon completion.
